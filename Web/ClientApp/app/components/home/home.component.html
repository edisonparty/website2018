                <p>
                    Edison is the biggest multiplatform demoparty in Sweden and has been around since 2011.
                </p>
                <h3 class="section-title">Venue</h3>
                <p>
                    The venue Eggeby Gård is a converted barn with plenty of space, an open field for camping,
                    free parking and the Stockholm metro system nearby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's a perfect place to experience
                    the Swedish summer, meeting other sceners outside in the warm sun or working on your
                    production inside the barn while it rains.
